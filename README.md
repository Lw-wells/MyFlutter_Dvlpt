Week 4: Introduction to Flutter
Objective:
Gain an understanding of Flutter, its benefits, and get started with setting up the
Flutter SDK. Learn to create simple UI elements using Flutter widgets.
Outcomes
By the end of this session, learners should be able to:
● Explain what Flutter is and its benefits for cross-platform development.
● Set up the Flutter SDK and development environment.
● Build simple stateless widgets to create a basic UI.
Duration: 105 minutes
Lesson Outline:
1. What is Flutter? (20 minutes)
Introduction to Flutter:
● What Flutter is: A framework for building natively compiled applications for
mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
● How it works: The architecture of Flutter — from widgets to the rendering
engine.
●
● Real-Time Examples: Show how Flutter helps in rapid prototyping and
beautiful UIs.
Benefits of Flutter:
● Cross-Platform Development: One codebase for Android, iOS, and even web
applications.
● Hot Reload: See the changes instantly without restarting the app.
● Rich Widget Set: Pre-built, customizable widgets that save time.
Real-World Applications:
● Discuss popular apps like Google Ads, Reflectly, Alibaba, etc., that are built
using Flutter.
2. Setting Up Flutter (30 minutes)
Installing Flutter SDK:
● Walk learners through downloading and installing the Flutter SDK from the
official website.
Setting Up the IDE:
● Installing Android Studio or Visual Studio Code: Which IDE should they use
and why?
● Flutter Plugin: Install the Flutter plugin to work with Flutter in your chosen
IDE.
Verification:
● Learners run flutter doctor to check if their installation is set up correctly.
●
Hands-on Activity:
● Guide learners through installing the Flutter SDK and setting up the IDE.
● Ensure learners can verify the installation successfully using flutter doctor.
3. Getting Started with Flutter Widgets (45
minutes)
Understanding Widgets:
● What are Widgets? Everything in Flutter is a widget. UI elements are all
widgets.
● Types of Widgets: Discuss stateless vs. stateful widgets and their use cases.
Building Simple Stateless Widgets:
● Stateless Widgets: Explore basic widgets like Text, Button, Image, and
Container.
● Creating a Simple App: Show how to create a Flutter app that uses these
basic widgets.
Hands-on Activity:
● Step-by-Step Coding:
1. Build a basic Flutter app with a Text widget that says "Hello, Flutter!"
2. Add a Button that prints a message to the console when pressed.
3. Display an image from the internet or local assets using an Image
widget.
● Engagement:
Encourage learners to use AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini to assist in their
●
coding tasks, search for documentation, or even troubleshoot common errors
they might encounter during the activity.
4. Recap and Q&A (10 minutes)
Recap Key Points:
● Summary: Flutter's architecture, benefits, setting up the development
environment, and building simple stateless widgets.
Q&A Session:
● Open the floor for learners to ask questions, clarify doubts, and get additional
support for any tricky concepts or tasks.
Assignment:
● Learners will complete a set of exercises on the LMS:
○ Install Flutter SDK and set up the environment.
○ Build a basic app using the widgets covered in class (Text, Button,
Image).
